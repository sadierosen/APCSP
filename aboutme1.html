    	<p>Hi! My name is Sadie Rosen and I am a junior at Piedmont High School. I love to cook and I love to draw. I am interested in tennis and I like to go to the gym. I am very interested in politicals and the psychology of the brain. I have lived in Californai my whole life and I love it here, there is anything you could ask for in a couple mile radius. From snow to beach, we have it all. I live with my younger sister Lila, and my two parents, Larry and Shelley. We also have the cutest dog in the whole world, Maccabbee!</p>
